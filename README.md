# School-Grade-Readabiltiy
One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output what (U.S.) grade level is needed to understand the text. The formula is:  index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8 Here, L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.  Letâ€™s write a program called readability that takes a text and determines its reading level. For example, if user types in a line from Dr. Seuss:  $ ./readability Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away! Grade 3 The text the user inputted has 65 letters, 4 sentences, and 14 words. 65 letters per 14 words is an average of about 464.29 letters per 100 words. And 4 sentences per 14 words is an average of about 28.57 sentences per 100 words. Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, and rounded to the nearest whole number, we get an answer of 3: so this passage is at a third grade reading level.
